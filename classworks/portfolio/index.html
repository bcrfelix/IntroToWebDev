                    </p>
                    <p>I currently work for Amazon as a Fulfillment Associate, it's my first job here in Canada.

                    <h2><em>Past Experiences</em></h2>
                    <p>I studied Pschology when I was in the Philippines, I learned how to communicate well with people and understand their feelings. 
                    Psychology gave me the knowledge of being compassionate and taught me that mental health is important and can never be ignored. I was also able to learn how to listen without judgement 
                    and be reliable. .</p>
                    <p>I am a member of an organization that strives to help people in need. My organization conducts a food drive every year to collect donations that can be given to kids who live on the streets
                    to support them and let them have a better life. We also try to donate books and school supplies to help them learn the value of education.

                <article id="Hobbies">
                    <h2><em>Hobbies</em></h2>
                    <p>Baking is my favorite hobby, it's my stress reliever. I can still remember the first time I tried to bake, it was a chocolate chip cookie and my grandmother was the one who tried to eat it first, 
                    I was very nervous of the outcome on how it will taste and fortunately it turned out great and my grandma loved it. Baking became my way of saying thank you to the people around me by giving them 
                    delicious treats that they will surely love. .</p>
                    <p>I also love to watch movies and tv series. Watching different movies and tv series gives me a lot of knowledge towards other cultures and events, it makes me happy. </p>
